#### Abstract
We explore the potential of the National Water Model (NWM) Medium Range Forecast (MRF) and Extended Analysis and Assimilation (EANA) to provide vulnerable communities with useful hydrological information with a focus on regions with sparse streamflow observations. The NWM generates a variety of streamflow forecasts and simulations for over 2.7 million stream reaches across the Conterminous United States (CONUS). The MRF is a 10-day streamflow forecast issued four times a day. The EANA is an observation driven streamflow simulation produced daily. We evaluate the performance of the MRF and EANA during two widespread flooding events with a focus on vulnerable communities as quantified by the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). SVI is a quantitative metric of a communityâ€™s relative vulnerability to natural and human-caused disasters. We demonstrate how an NWM evaluation can include broader societal impacts using the SVI and use the EANA to supplement observations in forecast verification. We apply these methods using the OWPHydroTools suite of Python-based hydrological evaluation tools and the dask Python library for efficient parallel computations.
